Create me a S&500 Tracker dashboard that showcases the most recently visited S&500 company. Also include a navbar that allows me to pull up a side menu. The navbar should also have a profile picture that is clickable 



What I need to Calculate:
Average Visits |
Total Visits   |
Monthly Visits |

CompanyName = "Netflix"

DataPoints:
[
{Year: 2024, Date(Date): 01/02/24, Last_Updated(Time Stamp): 5:32 PM, Total_Clicks: 23, Monthly_Clicks: 32, Clicks_in_Day: 53, FetchedClicks: 34},

{Year: 2024, Date(Date): 01/03/24, Last_Updated(Time Stamp): 5:32 PM, Total_Clicks: 23, Monthly_Clicks: 32, Clicks_in_Day: 53}
]
* Note that 
Clicks_in_Day = (previous Clicks - Current Clicks)
Previous Clicks = Clicks on previous day
Current Clicks = Current Scraped Clicks

If there is no Previous Day, then we will need to just rely on the Monthly_Clicks:
Procedure if this edge case:
	- Scrape Monthly Clicks, then set that to Clicks_in_day
	- If Monthly_Clicks and Clicks_in_day seem different on the next fetch, now we take the difference between the two, and then save that as the Clicks_in_day


Main Issue is that we need to fix that there are too many API requests. Let's limit one user to request once a day.
